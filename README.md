# triangularHello
Why not say hello triangularly?

This is a simple Python program with an included executable to play around with saying hello (triangularly).

Its functions are made using the concept of recursion and it was a fun project that I decided to make after the all-so-boring traditional "Hello World!" ones.


Update 07/29/2023:
- Merged the two functions into one to reduce unnecessary complexity;
- Changed comments and variable/function names to adhere to the "Clean Code" standards;
- Added check_user_input function to check if an integer was typed;
- Added line skips for clarity;
- Rebuilt the executable with the aforementioned changes.
